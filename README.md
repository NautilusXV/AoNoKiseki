# Ao No Kiseki PPSSPP HD Texture Pack
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8qzQIi6.png)

This pack changes many textures (NOT ALL) that appear throughout the game. These textures were obtained/taken from the PC version of the game.

This will never be complete because there are way too many textures to replace. The "main" focus was to replace the location textures. But overall the game should look better.

Here's what to expect with the texture pack:
```
HD UI

Prestory Section in HD

Playstation 4(DS4) Buttons

Translated Battle Menu(Mostly)

Character Portaits(Not Complete)

"Extra" section(Mostly complete)

Translated Character Names for Camp Menu

Title Screen/Main Menu/Background Images in HD

Multiple pages in the Detective Notebook translated

Many textures of locations you visit in the game are mostly or partially in HD

Misc Textures (effects, True Demon Earnest, minimap, things I haven't mentioned, etc)

# Latest Version: Ver. 2.3.4
Download https://github.com/NautilusXV/AoNoKisekiPSP/releases


## Installation
Extract the "NPJH50473" folder to your "TEXTURES" folder. **ppsspp\memstick\PSP\TEXTURES**

If the TEXTURES folder doesn't exist, create it.

Start PPSSPP, then go to Settings/Tools/Developer tools, scroll down to texture replacement and make sure "replace textures" is CHECKED.

For future updates, delete the old "NPJH50473" folder and replace with new one.


## Notes
I recommend using the latest PPSSPP builds https://buildbot.orphis.net/ppsspp/

Also, you should change the emulator settings if you want.

# Future Update

### Texture Replacement for the following locations:

```
The Tower of Stargaze

The Temple of Moon

Merkabah Airship
```

At the moment, I'm just dumping the textures of the psp & pc versions. It's gonna be awhile before I actually start replacing stuff. I'll upload the "dumps" so you can see what they are and how different they look from each other.

#### The PC version is just the better version and the one I'd rather spend my time messin' with. Mainly because it's a lot faster/easier to tinker with. So once I'm done with these, that's it. I won't even mess with the final dungeon and its extensions(Boss levels) <_<
