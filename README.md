# AoNoKiseki PPSSPP HD Texture Pack
This pack changes many textures (NOT ALL) that appear throughout the game. These textures were obtained/taken from the PC version of the game.

This will never be complete because there are way too many textures to replace. The "main" focus was to replace the location textures. But overall the game should look better.

Here's what to expect with the texture pack:
```
HD UI

Prestory Section in HD

Playstation 4(DS4) Buttons

Translated Battle Menu(Mostly)

Character Portaits(Not Complete)

"Extra" section to be mostly in HD

Translated Character Names for Camp Menu

Title Screen/Main Menu/Background Images in HD

Multiple pages in the Detective Notebook translated

Many textures of locations you visit in the game are mostly or partially in HD

Misc Textures (effects, True Demon Earnest, minimap, things I haven't mentioned, etc)
```
